Projects to become Java Developer by JetBrains academy

## Readability
https://hyperskill.org/projects/39
<p>About</p>
Everyone has their own personal reading history, and as we grow up, we are able to comprehend more and more complicated texts. But how do you estimate the level of difficulty of a given text, and how do you teach a computer to do that? In this project, you will find it out: write a program that determines how difficult the text is and for which age it is most suitable.

## LinearEquationsSolver
https://hyperskill.org/projects/40
<p>About</p>
You’ve come so far! Yet sometimes it’s nice to get back to old and simple basics: shall we remember some linear algebra? In this project, you will write a program that solves linear equations (you wish you had it back at school, don’t you?) It won’t be working with powers and radicals, but on the other hand, it will be able to handle matrices and complex numbers.

## SmartCalculator
https://hyperskill.org/projects/42
<p>About</p>
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

## MazeRunner
https://hyperskill.org/projects/47
<p>About</p>
Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. In this project, you will write a program that generates mazes and looks for a way out.

## SortingTool
https://hyperskill.org/projects/45
<p>About</p>
As we’re embracing Information Age, data becomes so abundant that processing it is no easy business. Names and numbers: how does one make sense of them? In this project, you will be writing a program that processes textual and numeric data and sorts it nicely. Make it a truly talented program: enable it to determine the biggest or most frequent pieces of data and perform necessary calculations. Data is waiting to be sorted!

## GameOfLife
https://hyperskill.org/projects/54
<p>About</p>
Get firsthand experience of creating a small inhabited universe and observe the many patterns in which this “life” can evolve. Generation by generation, watch the cells come and go, reacting to their environment, perishing from loneliness or finding comfort in company. In this project, you will write a simple “Game of Life”, a classic toy for programmers to entertain and educate themselves. Careful: might be hypnotizing!

## Text Editor
https://hyperskill.org/projects/38/
<p>About</p>
Looks like you like challenges! This project, however, is not too tricky if you’re feeling like an advanced learner. A text editor you’re going to write allows to search for specific files and open them. Check out the prerequisites, and if you’re ready, let’s roll!

## Budget Manager
https://hyperskill.org/projects/76
<p>About</p>
Not to sound overly serious, but it’s very important to manage your budget. This implies analyzing your expenses and estimating the income, which sometimes may be difficult to do yourself. Luckily, technology is there to assist: you can create your own personal budget manager program that counts the ins and outs and helps control the finances.

## Web Quiz Engine
https://hyperskill.org/projects/91
<p>About</p>
In the Internet, you can often find sites where you need to answer some questions. It can be educational sites, sites with psychological tests, job search services, or just entertaining sites like web quests. The common thing for them is the ability to answer questions (or quizzes) and then see some results. In this project, you will develop a multi-users web service for creating and solving quizzes.
